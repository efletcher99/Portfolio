                <h3>Sign Language Detection System</h3>
                <div class="side-by-side">
                    <p>The hand detection model I developed utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to accurately recognize 
                        and interpret all the letters of the alphabet as signed by users. This advanced system is designed 
                        to detect hand gestures and convert them into written text in real time, enabling seamless communication 
                        for individuals who use sign language. The potential applications of this model are vast and impactful. 
                        It can be integrated into video call platforms to facilitate real-time sign language interpretation, 
                        making virtual communication more inclusive. Additionally, this system can serve as an educational tool, 
                        helping students learn sign language through interactive and engaging methods. Furthermore, it bridges the 
                        communication gap between sign language users and those unfamiliar with it, fostering greater understanding 
                        and interaction in diverse settings. Add Github link</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Collaborating with a team of two other computer science students, we successfully met the predefined 
                        requirements to develop a web application for the SUU Youth Engineering Academy. This application 
                        enables teachers to take photos of students and scan the QR code on their badges, automatically associating 
                        each photo with the correct student. The photos are then sent to the camp director for verification. Once 
                        verified, the director emails the photos to the respective parents, who were linked to the photo when the 
                        camper's ID badge was scanned.Add Github link

                <h3>Southern Utah University Fall 2021 - Present</h3>
                <p>GPA 3.874</p>
                <p>My journey into the world of Computer Science started at SUU. After a suprising change from Kineseology, I 
                    found that the aspects of problem solving and technology peaked my interest. Throughout my academnic career I have had 
                    the opportunity to take many classes and learn about varios aspects that make up Computer Science. Some of my favorite
                    subjects have included Data Structures and Algorithms, Website Development, Database Design and Management, and Machine Learning. 
                    Data Structures and Algorithms provided me with a strong foundation in efficient data organization and manipulation. In
                    the Database Design and Management class I was able to delve into the principles of designing, implementng and managing 
                    databases. In Machine Learning I was able to explore the facinating realm of artificial intelligence and which algorithms and techniques
                    are used to form and create predictions based off of data.  </p>
                <h3>Utah State University Spring 2020 - Spring 2021</h3>
                <p>After a two year educational break to serve a religious mission in Argentina, I continued my higher education at Utah State 
                    University, initially pursuing a degree in kinesiology with the aim of becoming a physical therapist. During my studies, I 
                    gained a deeper understanding of the human body and its functions, which fueled my passion for learning and scientific inquiry. 
                    This background provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data analysis. As I delved 
                    into the intricacies of kinesiology, I discovered a growing interest in technology and its potential to enhance our understanding 
                    of complex systems. This led me to transition into computer science, where I could apply my analytical skills and scientific 
                    mindset to solve technical challenges. My unique perspective, rooted in both the life sciences and technology, enables me to 
                    approach technological problems with a innovative mindset.

                <h3>Westminster University Fall 2017</h3>
                <p>During my time at Wesminster University I had the opportunity to be part of Division II soccer program. This experience
                    was instrumental in shaping my character and work-ethic. As a student-athlete I learned the importance of hard work, 
                    perseverance, and teamwork. Being part of the soccer team taught me how to balance rigorous training schedules with 
                    academic responsibilities, honing my time management and organizational skills. The discipline required to excel both 
                    on the field and in the classroom has prepared me to tackle challenges with resilience and efficiency. This experience 
                    not only refined my ability to work hard but also underscored the value of balancing multiple important tasks simultaneously, 
                    a skill that is invaluable in both professional and personal contexts.</p>

                <h3>Casino Game Maker May 2023 - Present</h3>
                <p>Math Simulations - As a software developer at CGM, I developed a suite of C# programs to rigorously test and validate mathematical 
                    models created by outside mathematicians. These simulations ensured that the mathematical frameworks aligned perfectly with our 
                    intended gameplay mechanics. By implementing these tests early in the development process, we significantly reduced the overall 
                    development time, allowing for concurrent testing and development, and minimizing the need for post-development adjustments. </p>
                <p>Game Development - I contributed to the development of multiple games, utilizing both the Haxe language and Unity with C# scripting. 
                    My responsibilities spanned across various stages of the development process, including drafting white pages, coding, debugging, 
                    and preparing submission packages. By handling these critical tasks, I enabled senior software engineers to focus on more complex 
                    and demanding aspects of the projects.</p>
