            <div>
                <p>
                    Sum n Study is a web-based application developed using Flask that allows users to paste text into a 
                    textbox and instantly receive a concise summary. Using the BART model from the Hugging Face 
                    transformers library, the app can efficiently condense longer passages of text, making it easier for 
                    users to grasp essential information quickly. Additionally, Sum n Study includes error handling to guide 
                    users in adjusting their input if it exceeds the maximum token limit. Future updates aim to enhance 
                    the app with interactive quiz generation, allowing users to test their understanding of the summarized 
                    text and receive feedback on their responses.

            <h3>Sign Language Detection System</h3>
            <div class="side-by-side">
                <p>Hand Gesture Detection is an interactive machine learning project that empowers users to create a custom 
                        hand gesture dataset for alphabet letters, including a user-defined "space" gesture. Users can record 
                        unique hand gestures for each letter, then build, train, and refine a machine learning model tailored to 
                        their personal gestures. This project not only supports real-time gesture recognition testing but also 
                        provides a personalized experience in gesture recognition, as the model adapts specifically to each user’s 
                        movements. Potential applications include sign language interpretation, interactive input systems, and 
                        enhanced accessibility tools, making Hand Gesture Detection a versatile tool for gesture-based machine 
                        learning applications.

            <div>
                <p>The SUU YEA Photo Uploader is a Django-based application developed to streamline photo management for the SUU 
                    Youth Engineering Academy, ensuring efficient and secure photo distribution to parents. Authorized users can 
                    upload candid photos, tagging campers to maintain organized records. The camp director has a dedicated page 
                    to approve or deny photos before they’re shared, adding a layer of oversight. Once approved, photos can be 
                    sent to parents via text. Additionally, the system supports importing camper registration data from Jotform 
                    CSV exports, making setup and management straightforward and seamless for administrators.

                <h3>Southern Utah University Fall 2021 - Present</h3>
                <p>GPA 3.874</p>
                <p>My journey into the world of Computer Science started at SUU. After a surprising change from Kinesiology, I found that the 
                    aspects of problem solving and technology peaked my interest. Throughout my academic career I have had the opportunity to 
                    take many classes and learn about various aspects that make up Computer Science. Some of my favorite subjects have included 
                    Data Structures and Algorithms, Website Development, Database Design and Management, and Machine Learning. Data Structures 
                    and Algorithms provided me with a strong foundation in efficient data organization and manipulation. In the Database Design 
                    and Management class I was able to delve into the principles of designing, implementing and managing databases. In Machine 
                    Learning I was able to explore the fascinating realm of artificial intelligence and which algorithms and techniques are used 
                    to form and create predictions based off of data.</p>
                <h3>Utah State University Spring 2020 - Spring 2021</h3>
                <p>After a two year educational break to serve a religious mission in Argentina, I continued my higher education at Utah State 
                    University, initially pursuing a degree in kinesiology with the aim of becoming a physical therapist. During my studies, I 
                    gained a deeper understanding of the human body and its functions, which fueled my passion for learning and scientific inquiry. 
                    This background provided me with a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and data analysis. As I delved 
                    into the intricacies of kinesiology, I discovered a growing interest in technology and its potential to enhance our understanding 
                    of complex systems. This led me to transition into computer science, where I could apply my analytical skills and scientific 
                    mindset to solve technical challenges. My unique perspective, rooted in both the life sciences and technology, enables me to 
                    approach technological problems with a innovative mindset.

                <h3>Westminster University Fall 2017</h3>
                <p>During my time at Westminster University I had the opportunity to be part of the Division II soccer program. This experience was 
                    instrumental in shaping my character and work-ethic. As a student-athlete I learned the importance of hard work, perseverance, 
                    and teamwork. Being part of the soccer team taught me how to balance rigorous training schedules with academic responsibilities, 
                    honing my time management and organizational skills. The discipline required to excel both on the field and in the classroom has 
                    prepared me to tackle challenges with resilience and efficiency. This experience not only refined my ability to work hard but also 
                    underscored the value of balancing multiple important tasks simultaneously, a skill that is invaluable in both professional and 
                    personal contexts.</p>

                <h3>Casino Game Maker May 2023 - Present</h3>
                <p>Math Simulations - As a software developer at CGM, I developed a suite of C# programs to rigorously test and validate mathematical 
                    models created by outside mathematicians. These simulations ensured that the mathematical frameworks aligned perfectly with our 
                    intended gameplay mechanics. By implementing these tests early in the development process, we significantly reduced the overall 
                    development time, allowing for concurrent testing and development, and minimizing the need for post-development adjustments. </p>
                <p>Game Development - I contributed to the development of multiple games, utilizing both the Haxe language and Unity with C# scripting. 
                    My responsibilities spanned across various stages of the development process, including drafting white pages, coding, debugging, 
                    and preparing submission packages. By handling these critical tasks, I enabled senior software engineers to focus on more complex 
                    and demanding aspects of the projects.</p>
